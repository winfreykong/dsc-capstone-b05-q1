## Exploring Noise Distributions in Diffusion Models: A Comparative Analysis and Application
### FA23 DSC Capstone Project Description
This project aims to explore the effect of non-Gaussian distributions, combined with other loss functions on the outcome of **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)**. The project also show and elucidate how varying the parameters of Gaussian distributions lead to different outcomes.

### Software dependencies
We will include a requirements.txt file denoting the libraries installed in our Python environment, including Jupyter Notebook, PyTorch, Matplotlib, and TorchVision. Running pip install -r requirements.txt will create an environment that will allow you to run ddpm.ipynb.
